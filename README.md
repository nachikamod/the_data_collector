# data_collector

Back when our team was chosen for the Texas Instruments India Inovation Challenge Design Contest. In order to train our models, we needed a large amount of data. However, both the market and the open source community lacked the data we needed. Finally, we decided to create an app and distribute it to people who will collect data on our behalf, similar to Google's crowd sourcing in exchange for a leader board or possibly semi-premium or premium returns.

It remains unfinished, as with the most of my work.

However, one of my clients just offered me the opportunity to create a child of this application to collect data for personal use.
The true explanation behind why I created this application is that I was sick of working as a freelancer in the software development field and was on the verge of making one of the most important decisions of my life, namely, leaving this field of work. Fortunately, or perhaps sadly, we recently celebrated our friend's birthday and contributed to his present of a gaming mouse. I was short on cash at the time of contribution, so I borrowed Rs. 1000 from a buddy.I chose to postpone the return to a later date because it was my self-imposed rule not to borrow money from my father for self-entertainment expenses.

I was just killing time on freelancer.com a week ago when I came across an advertisement for an android application. And then it occurred to me that I needed to return the $1,000 to my friend. I researched other developers' quotes, and while this type of application should be quoted at least Rs. 10,000 to begin with, I quoted Rs. 1000, the absolute lowest anyone can quote! What is the reason for this? Because I only owed Rs. 1000.

Isn't it hilarious? The purpose was to inform my friend that I had submitted this application for only Rs. 1000 and that I would be returning his money. To make him forget about the months of debt I owed him and replace it with this awesome stunt.
